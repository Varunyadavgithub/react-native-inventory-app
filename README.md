# 📦 Inventory Management App (React Native)

A simple **Inventory Management mobile application** built with **React Native**.  
This app helps track items, monitor low stock, and manage inventory with add, edit, and delete functionality.

This project was created as a **first React Native app** to practice core concepts like state management, conditional rendering, and list handling.
